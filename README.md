# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-using-Wisconsin-data-

## Objective: 
To develop a predictive model that uses patient diagnostic characteristics to predict if the cancer is malignant or benign. This model will help physicians and healthcare professionals identify the stage of cancer, and the factors contributing to the diagnosis in order to implement more effective prevention strategies.

## Dataset: 
The datset is downloaded from UCI machine learning repository. The Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

**The dataset contains 32 columns and 569 rows.**
